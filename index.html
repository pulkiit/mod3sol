				Paneer Makhani
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				
				<p>Paneer makhani (also called paneer butter masala) is a slightly sweet creamy dish of paneer, originating from the Indian subcontinent, in which the gravy is prepared usually with butter (makhan), tomatoes, cashews or cream. Spices such as red chili powder and garam masala are also used to prepare this gravy. It’s kind of an unsaid rule that if you are Punjabi you’ve got to love paneer and I am no different. This versatile Indian cheese is used in an array of vegetarian recipes especially in North India. In this recipe chunks of fresh cottage cheese are cooked in a rich creamy onion tomato masala and a good dose of butter, only to be finished off with another dollop of fresh cream. So its fully loaded! This paneer butter masala recipe is a fool proof one and tastes great with any kind of roti or plain old jeera rice. If you like Indian vegetarian food this one will tick all the boxes for you.</p><p><br><a href="#top">Go to Top</a></p>

				Khaman Dhokla 
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Fermented gram flour and yogurt batter steamed, cut into cakes and tempered with mustard seeds and topped with fresh coriander and grated coconut.You don’t have to be from Gujarat to have tasted a khaman dhokla. A thick fermented gram flour and yogurt batter steamed till it’s like a soft fluffy pillow. Cooled, cut into squares tempered with mustard seeds and garnished with fresh coriander and scraped coconut – a dhokla is Gujarat’s pride. This very same dhokla can be crumbed and served with accompaniments like assorted chutneys, fried green chillies and a delicious raw papaya salad in a different avatar known as khaman. My mother-in-law adds a pinch of sugar to the batter to match every Guajarati’s love for a hint of sweetness in their food. Minus the time it takes for fermentation, it is a quick recipe which makes a delicious snack anytime of the day. </p><p><br><a href="#top">Go to Top</a></p>

					<p>
					Indian version of the popular continental mashed potatoes – very flavorful and tasty.Why is it that when you are stuck at “what should we cook today” the answer is always “make some aloo!” Potatoes are like this…extremely popular and have multipurpose usage. And did you always think that eating a potato will make you fat? Well, don’t – it is a surprising source of vitamin C and provides useful amounts of starch, thiamine and niacin and around a hundred grams will provide about eighty calories. Little did you know!</p><p><br><a href="#top">Go to Top</a></p></section>
